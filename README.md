# Software Security

Code for Software Security Class in Zhejiang University.

The code is written for educational purpose only, and works (as it is) on x86_64 architecture. 

You need to install `pwntools` to use most of the scripts.  

```bash
pip install pwntools
```

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please contact me (yajin_zhou@zju.edu.cn).
